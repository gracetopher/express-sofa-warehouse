======================

Showcase of code for my Express Sofa Warehouse project to demonstrate how I have used PHP to template the website,
and also make it easy for the CMS administrator to make content changes using 'Surreal CMS'.

index.php

The index file shows how I have used PHP include statements to add the header and footer. This allows me to make changes 
to one file, which will then be saved across the entire website.

I have also used PHP include statements here to add the product thumbnails to the 'featured products' category.
All product thumbnails are used more then once throughout the website, making it easy for both the CMS administrator
and myself to make changes.
